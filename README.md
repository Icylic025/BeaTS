# BPM Finder

## A Software that finds BPM of songs with some practical applications

### What Will This Application Do?
This is a program is able to identify the bpm (beat per minute) of songs the user input and sort a playlist of music accordingly.
It will include some applications for the bpm. Although these features are not guaranteed and may not be applied in 
later phases. 
They include:

**Exercise Features**
- A bpm detector for exercising from user input. The user can tap out their bpm for activities such as running, walking,
swimming, skiing, weight lifting etc.
  - The application can find list of songs with the same bpm as user's activity. When the user listens to this filtered
  playlist, the music will match the pace of running, walking, or whatever activity the user is doing.
- A pace setter
  - If the user wants to walk a certain distance in a certain timeframe. With some user input such their stride length.
The application can find songs that set the correct pace for the user.
  
**Music and Editing Features**
- Application can match a song with a beat from a timestamp of a video

### Who will use it?
This application will be usable for many people including those who exercise, music producers, video editors, etc.

### Why is this project of interest to you?
I want to do a music related project since I am heavily inspired by many music artists. Originally for this project I was
considering simply making a music streaming platform. However, that project is too simple. Since some of my favourite music
artists are producers, I want to experience what they do and get involved with the backbone of creating music like the bpm.
I also found multiple practical uses for this project and as someone who runs and exercises a lot. I personally believe 
having a music pace setter will be very practical. 

### User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to insert wav files into a playlist of music
- As a user, I want to be able to view my playlist and shuffle the playlist
- As a user, I want to be able to filter the bpm of music files I input (perhaps initially bpm input can be done manually)
- As a user, I want to be able to manually input a beat and get filtered songs with the same bpm
